🚀 Full Stack Data Science with GenAI & Agentic AI – Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! 🌱
This repo is a living record of my journey through Full Stack Data Science with a strong focus on Generative AI and Agentic AI.

📌 Current Stage

🔹 I am currently exploring Machine Learning (ML) fundamentals, covering:

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Supervised & Unsupervised learning

Model evaluation & optimization

Hands-on projects with real-world datasets

🎯 My Goal

My ultimate aim is to build powerful GenAI & Agentic AI systems leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and cutting-edge frameworks.

✔️ End-to-end projects will move from ML → Deep Learning → NLP → LLMs → GenAI → Agentic AI
✔️ This repo will grow step by step with code, projects, and notes
✔️ Final milestone → Building Agentic AI solutions capable of autonomous decision-making with LLMs
